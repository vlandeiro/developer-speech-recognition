# Developer Speech Recognition

Speech recognition aiming to ease the work of software developers

## Goals:

Here is a quick and unorganized list of the goals we want to achieve while developing this application (+ signs defines the difficulty of the task: the more + signs, the harder the task):

- adapt speech recognition to software development (++)
- support multiple languages (Python, Java, C, etc) (+)
- works on multiple softwares (Eclipse, SublimeText, Atom, Visual Studio, etc) (++)
- offer 'vocal macros': e.g. the user says "if else block" and it writes: (+)

  if cond:
    do1
  else:
    do2
    
- recognize already existing variables (+++)
- adapt speech recognition to each user (+++)
